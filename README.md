# Climate-Change
**Can we observe changes in temperature trends from local data that also reflect global climate change? Daily weather data from six years from the Los Angeles International Airport are analyzed.**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Purpose:**
----------
According to NOAA climate.gov, “Earth’s temperature has risen by an average of 0.11° 
Fahrenheit (0.06° Celsius) per decade since 1850, or about 2° F in total.” This raises questions, 
such as if climate is rising over decades on a global scale, can we observe changes in temperature 
trends from local data that also reflect this trend? The purpose of this report is to analyze six 
datasets consisting of daily weather observations from six different years (1963, 1975, 1987, 
1999, 2011, and 2023) from a randomly selected airport (Los Angeles International Airport, CA, 
US). These weather factors, such as mean temperature, wind speed, and dew point interact with 
categorical variables like year, season, and visibility range. Exploratory data analysis, ANOVA, 
t-tests, and simple regression will be used to analyst and interpret the relationships among the 
datasets and explore trends across the years, seasons, and other weather factors. 

**User Instructions:**
----------------------
This code was built in SAS.
To utilize the code, copy code into a new SAS program and change the filepath to the filepath of your dataset's file location. The code will be ready to run.

**Technology Requirements:**
----------------------------
This project was built using SAS code. Access to SAS 9.4 or SAS Studio is required to utilize this project.

**Project Owner:**
------------------
This project was created by Brianna Noel, a graduate student at Kennesaw State University in the Data Science and Analytics program.
